	//Drones are identified by their serial numbers. A vector of serial numbers for currently connected drones
	//can be retrieved by the drone manager and individual drones can be accessed by serial number. Once a drone
	//object is created for a drone with a specific serial, the drone object should remain in existence for the
	//lifetime of the program, even if the connection to it is lost. If the connection is re-established, the
	//new connection should be attached to the existing drone object. This way, a valid pointer to a drone object
	//provided by the drone manager will never be invalidated in the future.
